# Order Streaming

Our DEX introduces a unique concept: instead of settling trades instantly, trades can be **streamed continuously** over a time horizon.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. User specifies a trade amount and time horizon. (e.g., 10 tokens streamed over 50 slots.)
2. Each slot gets an equal portion of the total trade (e.g., 0.2 tokens per slot).
3. At the end of each slot:
   - A market-clearing price is recalculated based on all active orders.
   - Assets are swapped at this price.

This approach ensures:

- **Fair Markets:** As trades are distributed across many slots, reducing the likelihood of price manipulation.
- **Better Prices:** Streaming allows you to average out prices over time, reducing volatility and reducing your price impact.
