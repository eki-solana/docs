_Some sentences why DEXes are better than CEXes_

However, DEXs introduced their own set of challenges, including:

- **Dependence on Liquidity Providers:** Liquidity pools often result in slippage, high trading fees, and low scalability
- **Toxic MEV:** Malicious actors can extract value by reordering, including, or excluding transactions in a block.

We’ve developed a **revolutionary market mechanism** that addresses these issues head-on: **Streaming Swaps**

**What It Does:**

- Trades are not settled instantly. Instead, they are streamed over time at prices determined in frequent batch auctions.

- This approach eliminates front-running and price manipulation while removing the need for liquidity providers.

For the first time in financial history, our DEX creates a **truly fair market** where:

- Every trader gets the best possible price.

- The market operates transparently without intermediaries or unfair practices.

With this innovation, we’re setting a new standard for decentralized trading.
