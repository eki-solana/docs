# Frequent Batch Auctions

Unlike conventional exchanges that execute trades individually, frequent batch auctions process multiple trades in bulk over short, predefined intervals. Here's why this matters:

- **Fair Pricing:** The market-clearing price is determined for all trades in the batch, ensuring fairness.

- **Reduced Manipulation:** Bots canâ€™t front-run orders within a batch since all trades are settled together.
